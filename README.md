## 😀 Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Minho Jang.

Modern services are more than simple problem solving, they are complex challenges that require multiple perspectives and multi-faceted analysis. To capture and solve these complexities, I hold a deep understanding of the design and flow of services as one of the most important values of an engineer.

I believe that every service is made up of a set of interconnected pipelines, and when you look at the role each pipeline plays and the structure of the service as a whole from an architect's perspective, you gain a clearer understanding of the nature of the problem. With this insight, I constantly strive to be able to analyze problems from multiple angles and propose optimal solutions.

I want to grow into an irreplaceable engineer who can solve complex problems with a deep understanding of design.

## 🏆 **Achievements**

**Securing service stability and scalability through design-centered thinking**: By utilizing a 3-Tier architecture and KakaoCloud, we built a stable operating environment for the workplace welfare service and secured the long-term stability of the system by designing for future expansion and maintenance. By establishing a separate CI/CD workflow based on GitHub Actions, we improved deployment automation and operational efficiency. In addition, by introducing the UseCase hierarchy, we prevented possible conflicts during development collaboration and improved code quality.

**Real-time service monitoring and reliable infrastructure operations**: A dating service for 300+ users secured service stability by building AWS-based infrastructure and implementing a real-time monitoring system utilizing the ELK stack. We prevented service interruptions by monitoring disk usage and setting alarms through CloudWatch, and increased development efficiency by building a Jenkins-based CI/CD pipeline. We also contributed to improving user satisfaction by actively reflecting user feedback and improving features such as Kakao login switching and inactive user prevention.

**Designed and implemented MSA architecture based on Amazon EKS**: Designed and implemented MSA architecture based on Amazon EKS in a low-grade student collaboration platform to provide optimized service performance through efficient resource utilization and service isolation. Built CDC and ETL pipelines to ensure data consistency and enhance real-time analytics capabilities; shortened development cycles and ensured stable software releases by building automated CI/CD pipelines; and improved user-friendliness through the design of STT service integration pipelines.

**Dramatically improved image search speed and accuracy**: Reduced image similarity search speed by 99.8% by building a FAISS-based vector database in a fashion search app, and improved image feature extraction accuracy by 7% by introducing the EfficientNetB3 model. Collected unstructured data through Python-based web scraping, and designed and implemented a cloud infrastructure based on Google Cloud Platform to provide users with a fast and accurate search experience.

**Built and shared a cloud-based CDC & ETL pipeline**: Wrote code to leverage Terraform to provision AWS Managed Service and build a CDC pipeline, which was shared with Cloud Club members to help spread knowledge.

**Organized and ran Git/GitHub training programs**: As a core member of GDG on Campus, planned and ran the “GitHub Sprout Sessions” program and created training materials to help participants improve their Git/GitHub skills.

## 📚 **Certifications**
