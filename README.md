## 😀 Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Minho Jang, an engineer who provides solutions through systematic design.

Modern services are more than simple problem solving, they are complex challenges that require multiple perspectives and multi-faceted analysis. To capture and solve these complexities, I hold a deep understanding of the design and flow of services as one of the most important values of an engineer.

I believe that every service is made up of a set of interconnected pipelines, and when you look at the role each pipeline plays and the structure of the service as a whole from an architect's perspective, you gain a clearer understanding of the nature of the problem. With this insight, I constantly strive to be able to analyze problems from multiple angles and propose optimal solutions.

I want to grow into an irreplaceable engineer who can solve complex problems with a deep understanding of design.
